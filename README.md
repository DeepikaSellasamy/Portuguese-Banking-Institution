# Portuguese-Banking-Campaign


 #### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

   * The Portuguese bank has experienced a decline in revenue and is looking to determine what actions to take.

   * After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as they had been previously.

   * Therefore, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients who have a higher chance of subscribing to a term deposit and focus their marketing efforts         on these clients.

#### ABOUT DATASET:

* This is a dataset that describes the results of Portugal's bank marketing campaigns.

* The campaigns conducted were mostly based on direct phone calls, offering bank clients the opportunity to place a term deposit.

* If, after all marking efforts, the client agreed to place a deposit, the target variable was marked as "yes"; otherwise, it was marked as "no".

#### ABOUT PROJECT:

* In this project, I will analyze the bank leads dataset and create a classification algorithm from my perspective.
